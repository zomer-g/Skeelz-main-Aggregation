The script is designed to produce an aggregation of 4 different tables at the ID level of candidates and positions in the SKEELZ system.

The first table is the Auto fit data table and it includes in the first column the ID of a candidate, in the second column the ID of a position and in the third page a numerical value of the degree of compatibility between the candidate and the position.

The second table is Interested Daily and includes in the first column a candidate ID, in the second column a position ID and in the third page the earliest date on which the candidate indicated that he was interested in the position.

The third table is Dashboard Form and it includes in the first column the ID of a candidate, in the second column the ID of a position and on the third page comments given when some of the comments refer to the connection between a candidate and a position, some only to the candidate (no matter which position) and some only to the position (no matter who the candidate is).

The fourth table is New position form and it includes in the first column a position ID and in the following columns details of the position's contact person. These details are inherently correct for all positions.

The purpose of the script is to take all the sources of information and combine them into one table, which will display all the connections between a candidate and a position, and for each connection all the details about it from the various sources. Regarding information at the candidate level or at the position level, this information is duplicated for all mentions of the candidate or position.
